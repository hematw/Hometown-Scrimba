                    <h1>Afghanistan</h1>
                    <p>Afghanistan is located in Central Asia with Iran to the west and Pakistan to the east. Tall,
                        forbidding mountains and dry deserts cover most of the landscape of Afghanistan. The jagged
                        mountain
                        peaks are treacherous, and are snow covered for most of the year.</p>

                    <p>Afghans live in the fertile valleys between the mountains and grow their crops and tend to their
                        animals. Only 20 percent of the land is used as fields.</p>

                    <p>Summers are hot and dry but the winters are very cold, especially north of the Hindu Kush, which
                        is
                        located in the eastern part of the country near Pakistan and Tajikistan. Many rivers flow
                        through
                        the mountain gorges. Snow melt and rain that flow out of the Hindu Kush pool into a low area and
                        never reach the ocean.</p>
